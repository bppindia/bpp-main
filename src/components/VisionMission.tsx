                                        At Bharatiya Popular Party (BPP), our vision is to introduce an innovative,
                                        decentralized mechanism within the party&#39;s power structure. We believe that
                                        decision-making should be more inclusive, transparent, and closer to the people. By
                                        empowering local communities and leaders, we aim to create a system where power
                                        is distributed equitably, encouraging greater participation, and responsiveness. This
                                        will ensure that every individual has a voice in the decision-making process, leading
                                        to a more democratic, fair, and effective governance structure.
