              Mission Statement
            </h3>
            <p>
              At Bhartiya Popular Party, our mission is to eradicate the
              influence of muscle and money power in politics and governance,
              ensuring that ethics, morale and community service become the true
              pillars of public life.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are committed to restoring faith in democracy by fighting
              corruption, upholding transparency, and empowering every citizen
              to participate meaningfully in the democratic process.
            </p>
            <p className='my-2 font-bold'>
              We envision a nation where opportunities are not determined by
              wealth or status, but by talent and hard work.
