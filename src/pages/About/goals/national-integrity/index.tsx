              Mission Statement
            </h3>
            <p>
              For Bharatiya Popular Party, National Integrity is the spirit of
              unity, where every citizen stands together, regardless of their
              caste, religion, or community. For us, National Integrity is the
              strength that binds us as one nation — a reflection of the
              principle of
            </p>
            <p className='font-bold'>
              ‘Ek-Anek aur Ekta’ — &quot;Unity in Diversity.&quot;
            </p>
            <p className='mt-4'>
              To us, National Integrity is not just a concept; it is the
              backbone of a peacefully growing nation. It is our belief that
              despite our differences, we are all part of one country, sharing
              common identities, interests and goals. It is about celebrating
              our diversity while holding on to the core value that we are all
              brothers and sisters, united by the shared ideals of progress,
              peace, and equality.
