                            For Bharatiya Popular Party, National Integrity is the spirit of unity, where every citizen
                            stands together, regardless of their caste, religion, or community. For us, National Integrity
                            is the strength that binds us as one nation — a reflection of the principle of

                            To us, National Integrity is not just a concept; it is the backbone of a peacefully growing
                            nation. It is our belief that despite our differences, we are all part of one country, sharing
                            common identities, interests and goals. It is about celebrating our diversity while holding on
                            to the core value that we are all brothers and sisters, united by the shared ideals of
                            progress, peace, and equality.
