                                    At Bharatiya Popular Party (BPP), our vision is to introduce an innovative,
                                    decentralized mechanism within the party's power structure. We believe that
                                    decision-making should be more inclusive, transparent, and closer to the people. By
                                    empowering local communities and leaders, we aim to create a system where power
                                    is distributed equitably, encouraging greater participation, and responsiveness. This
                                    will ensure that every individual has a voice in the decision-making process, leading
                                    to a more democratic, fair, and effective governance structure.

                                    respecting regional diversity.
